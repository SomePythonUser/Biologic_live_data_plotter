# Biologic_live_data_plotter
Tool for plotting of live cyclic voltammetry (CV) data as it is being collected by the proprietary software Biologic which comes with many potentiostats used for electrochemistry.

Requirements:
- The Galvani package (https://github.com/echemdata/galvani). Used for decyphering the binary proprietary data format .mpr which Biologic saves in.
- The mprReader package which is merely a small homemade script for data handling and wrangling
